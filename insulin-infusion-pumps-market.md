<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Infusion Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-Loop</li><li>Open-Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Insulin infusion pumps are categorized into two main types: closed-loop and open-loop systems. Closed-loop pumps, also known as automated or hybrid systems, automatically adjust insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring, enhancing user convenience and glycemic control. Open-loop systems require manual input from users to determine insulin doses, offering more control but demanding greater user engagement. Both types are designed to improve diabetes management, but they differ in automation and user interaction, impacting their adoption and market dynamics.</p></p>
