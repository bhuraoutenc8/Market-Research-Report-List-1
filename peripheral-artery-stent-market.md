<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Artery Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drug-eluting Stent</li><li>Bare Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peripheral artery stent market is primarily divided into drug-eluting stents and bare metal stents. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication that is gradually released to prevent artery re-blockage, offering improved long-term outcomes for patients. In contrast, bare metal stents are simple metallic structures that provide support to the artery but do not deliver any medication. Each type serves distinct patient needs based on the severity of arterial disease and the required treatment approach.</p></p>
